SublimeLinter 1.6.2 changelog

CHANGES/FIXES

- Replaced the default perl linter with Perl::Critic. The
  standard Perl syntax checker still be invoked by switching
  the "perl_linter" setting to "perl".


IMPORTANT

Due to a vulnerability (issue #77) with the Perl linter,
Perl syntax checking is no longer enabled by default. The
default linter for Perl has been replaced by Perl::Critic.
